Programming Assignment 2: N-Body Simulation


Please estimate the number of hours to complete this assignment:
Took me about an hour to write the program per se, but the debugging process
took like an hour and a half (close to two hours) which I did in the classroom.


/**********************************************************************

 *  or "Office hours on Thursday" is ok if you don't know their name.)
 **********************************************************************/

Yes or no? I recieved help from Lily(TA) and Jeremy(Ta) during the class trying
to debug something that wasn't making much sense.
/**********************************************************************
 *  Did you encounter any serious problems? If so, please describe.
 **********************************************************************/

Yes or no? No.
